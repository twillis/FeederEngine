==================
 Feeder Todo List
==================


At a high level there are some big pieces

   #. rss feed engine: takes a bunch of urls and periodically checks
    for updates and then puts that content somewhere for viewing.

   #. indexer. given a stream of data (from rss feeds) stem, catalog
    and all that

   #. web front-end(pretty much everything google reader does initially)
